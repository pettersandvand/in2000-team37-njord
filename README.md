# Njord - leeway simulation app
# in2000-team37-njord

Copy of private enterprise repo of project made by team 37 in course in2000 spring 2021, University of Oslo. The app was made in collaboration with the Norwegian Rescue Service (Redningsselskapet.no), to make the app as best as possible form a user perspective.

The goal of the app is to make it easy for the crew on boats to make leeway simulations, to make search and rescue more efficient. With just 3 clicks you can add a new simulation, and it is easy to see the results as well.

1. Added google maps api token to `local.properties` with variable name `API_KEY`
